                <p>Established in 2010 when the company started out, our Quality Assurance team consists of
                    seasoned veterans in the gaming field, with years of experience in all aspects of testing. While
                    initially we were just a small group of people passionate about games and making sure that our
                    final products are of the highest standard for our customers, Over the years we’ve grown into a
                    huge department with several sub-divisions each specializing on specific areas to ensure that all
                    forms of testing are fully covered.</p>

                            <p>Name: Shane Murphy<br>
                                Position: Lead Tester<br>
                                Division: Compliance<br>
                                Shane is from Cork but moved to Dublin 15 years ago. He’s
                                been working for our company for 8 years, and has been a
                                Lead Tester of the Compliance division for 4 years. He
                                started out in the User Experience Division, however he
                                requested a transfer to Compliance several months later, and
                                has been in love with the TRC ever since.
                                Shane is very detail-oriented (and a bit of a neat-freak). He has high expectations of his testers,
                                but his fair and just attitude motivates people to do their best when working with him. He likes to
                                spend his free time doing gardening and playing tennis. He is married with two kids and he’s
                                quite the family man. He tells dad-jokes at company parties.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>A Day in the Life</h2>
                <p>1. First things first. No day starts without coffee! <br>
                    2. A very important second step is to check your e-mails. Its the most important channel of
                    communication within the company, and that’s where all the newest information relevant to the
                    ongoing projects will show up first.<br>
                    3. Check the servers for new builds. Devs would normally announce that in an e-mail, but better
                    be sure.<br>
                    4. You’ve probably done this last night before leaving, but assess yesterday’s (or so far the entire
                    week’s) progress to see at what stage each ongoing task is at, and how much remains to be done
                    today/the rest of the week.<br>
                    5. Delegate the above assessed tasks to your testers. They’ve probably been continuing their
                    work from yesterday, so either reinforce this or give them a new task. Make sure to explain
                    everything patiently to avoid confusions later, and be available for any questions or uncertainties.<br>
                    6. It’s about time to answer all those e-mails you checked earlier and left hanging. It’s alright,
                    your testers had to start working for the sake of progress.<br>
                    7. Now you can start communicating on the company’s internal chat platform with the devs and
                    testers you’re working with. Only contact the Department Lead if absolutely necessary. They
                    have enough on their hands.<br>
                    8. Remember, communication is key. If you are unable to get across your ideas over the internet,
                    you can always drop by the other departments and clear things up face to face. This is also a
                    great opportunity to get to know the people you work with a bit better, and to remind yourself
                    from time to time that you work with complex flesh-and-blood humans just like yourself, not
                    machines.<br>
                    9. It’s about time for a lunch break.<br>
                    10. Right about now you’ll probably be having a short meeting about the project. This might
                    occur daily, but not necessarily. Depends entirely on the type of game, what stage it is in, and
                    what testing is being done on it at the moment.<br>
                    11. Don’t forget to check your e-mails from time to time.<br>
                    12. Remind your testers at what hour you expect their daily report to be sent.<br>
                    13. Check up on your testers from time to time. Not all of them are great at communicating, or
                    they might be struggling with an issue they are too ashamed to ask about for whatever reason. Be
                    available and understanding.<br>
                    14. Compile the daily reports you’ve received from your testers into one clear and concise report
                    that you can now send to the devs at the end of the day.<br>
                    15. Give positive reinforcements to your testers about their effort done today. Check up one more
                    time with your devs to make sure the report was received and there are no confusions about it.<br>
                    16. Discuss upcoming tasks for the next day with the devs. You can pass this information to your
                    testers if you like, so that they don’t have to wait up on you tomorrow. Transparency is key.<br>
                    17. Good job! You can go home now and get a well-deserved rest. Another day starts tomorrow!</p>
